  ## Description
  For this application I wanted to create a mock social media api that gives users the ability to create, delete, edit, and search for Users, Thoughts, and reactions. I also wanted to give the ability to add friends.

  ## Installation
  You must have Insomnia installed to be able to view the routes correctly. You will also need mongoose and node.js

  ## Usage
  To use the app run npm start to spool up the server. Then once that is done go into insomnia and use the routes to create, search, edit, and delete users and their thoughts and reactions!
